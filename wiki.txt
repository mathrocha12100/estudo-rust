Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.[12][13] Rust is syntactically similar to C++,[14] but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.[15] Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.[16][17] Rust has been called a systems programming language, and in addition to high-level features such as functional programming it also offers mechanisms for low-level memory management.

First appearing in 2010, Rust was designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research,[18] with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others.[19][20] The designers refined the language while writing the Servo experimental browser engine[21] and the Rust compiler. Rust's major influences include C++, OCaml, Haskell, and Erlang.[5] It has gained increasing use and investment in industry, by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft.

Rust has been voted the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016, and was used by 7% of the respondents in 2021.[22]
